# AnyCloud: MQTT Client

This code example demonstrates implementing an MQTT Client using the [AnyCloud MQTT Client library](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mqtt). The library uses the AWS IoT Device SDK MQTT Client library that includes an MQTT 3.1.1 Client.

In this example, the MQTT Client RTOS task establishes a connection with the configured MQTT Broker, and creates two tasks - Publisher and Subscriber. The Publisher task publishes messages on a topic when the user button is pressed on the kit. The Subscriber task subscribes to the same topic and controls the user LED based on the messages received from the MQTT Broker. In case of unexpected disconnection of MQTT or Wi-Fi connection, the application executes a reconnection mechanism to restore the connection.


**Sequence of operation**

1. The user button is pressed.

2. The GPIO interrupt service routine (ISR) notifies the Publisher task.

3. The Publisher task publishes a message on a topic.

4. The MQTT Broker sends back the message to the MQTT Client because it is also subscribed to the same topic.

5. When the message is received, the Subscriber task turns the LED ON or OFF. As a result, the user LED toggles every time the user presses the button.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC 6 Wi-Fi-Bluetooth pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ships with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This code example implements a generic MQTT Client that can connect to various MQTT Brokers. In this document, the instructions to set up and run the MQTT Client have been provided for the AWS IoT and Mosquitto MQTT Brokers for reference. If you are using this code example with Mosquitto broker running locally on your computer, you need to download and install Mosquitto Broker from https://mosquitto.org/download.

This example requires no additional software or tools if you are using the MQTT Client with a publicly hosted MQTT Broker.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. Enter the local path in the **Application(s) Root Path** field to indicate where the application needs to be created.

   Applications that can share libraries can be placed in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps:

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Windows, use the command line `modus-shell` program provided in the ModusToolbox installation instead of a standard Windows command line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu.

   In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

This example implements three RTOS tasks: MQTT Client, Publisher, and Subscriber. The main function initializes the BSP and the retarget-io library, and creates the MQTT Client task.

The MQTT Client task initializes the Wi-Fi connection manager (WCM) and connects to a Wi-Fi access point (AP) using the Wi-Fi network credentials that are configured in *wifi_config.h*. Upon a successful Wi-Fi connection, the task initializes the MQTT library and establishes a connection with the MQTT Broker/Server.

The MQTT connection is configured to be secure by default; the secure connection requires a client certificate, a private key, and the Root CA certificate of the MQTT Broker that are configured in *mqtt_client_config.h*.

After a successful MQTT connection, the Subscriber and Publisher tasks are created. The MQTT Client task then waits for commands from the other two tasks and callbacks to handle events like unexpected disconnections.

The Subscriber task initializes the user LED GPIO and subscribes to messages on the topic specified by the `MQTT_SUB_TOPIC` macro that can be configured in *mqtt_client_config.h*. When the Subscriber task receives a message from the Broker, it turns the user LED ON or OFF depending on whether the received message is "TURN ON" or "TURN OFF" (configured using the `MQTT_DEVICE_ON_MESSAGE` and `MQTT_DEVICE_OFF_MESSAGE` macros).

The Publisher task sets up the user button GPIO and configures an interrupt for the button. The ISR notifies the Publisher task upon a button press. The Publisher task then publishes messages (*TURN ON* / *TURN OFF*) on the topic specified by the `MQTT_PUB_TOPIC` macro. When the publish operation fails, a message is sent over a queue to the MQTT Client task.

An MQTT event callback function `mqtt_event_callback()` invoked by the MQTT library for events like MQTT disconnection and incoming MQTT subscription messages from the MQTT broker. In the case of an MQTT disconnection, the MQTT client task is informed about the disconnection using a message queue. When an MQTT subscription message is received, the subscriber callback function implemented in *subscriber_task.c* is invoked to handle the incoming MQTT message.

The MQTT client task handles unexpected disconnections in the MQTT or Wi-Fi connections by initiating reconnection to restore the Wi-Fi and/or MQTT connections. Upon failure, the Publisher and Subscriber tasks are deleted, cleanup operations of various libraries are performed, and then the MQTT client task is terminated.

**Note:** The CY8CPROTO-062-4343W board shares the same GPIO for the user button (USER BTN) and the CYW4343W host wakeup pin. Because this example uses the GPIO for interfacing with the user button to toggle the LED, the SDIO interrupt to wake up the host is disabled by setting `CY_WIFI_HOST_WAKE_SW_FORCE` to '0' in the Makefile through the `DEFINES` variable.

### Configuring the MQTT Client

#### Wi-Fi and MQTT configuration macros

| Macro                               |  Description              |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| **Wi-Fi Connection Configurations**  |  In *configs/wifi_config.h*  |
| `WIFI_SSID`       | SSID of the Wi-Fi AP to which the MQTT Client connects   |
| `WIFI_PASSWORD`   | Passkey/password for the Wi-Fi SSID specified above                 |
| `WIFI_SECURITY`   | Security type of the Wi-Fi AP. See `cy_wcm_security_t` structure in *cy_wcm.h* file for more details.      |
| `MAX_WIFI_CONN_RETRIES`   | Maximum number of retries for Wi-Fi connection   |
| `WIFI_CONN_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`   | Time interval in milliseconds in between successive Wi-Fi connection retries   |
| **MQTT Connection Configurations**  |  In *configs/mqtt_client_config.h*  |
| `MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS`      | Hostname of the MQTT Broker        |
| `MQTT_PORT`                | Port number to be used for the MQTT connection. As specified by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority), port numbers assigned for MQTT protocol are *1883* for non-secure connections and *8883* for secure connections. However, MQTT Brokers may use other ports. Configure this macro as specified by the MQTT Broker.                      |
| `MQTT_SECURE_CONNECTION`   | Set this macro to `1` if a secure (TLS) connection to the MQTT Broker is  required to be established; else `0`.         |
| `MQTT_USERNAME` <br> `MQTT_PASSWORD`   | User name and password for client authentication and authorization, if required by the MQTT Broker. However, note that this information is generally not encrypted and the password is sent in plain text. Therefore, this is not a recommended method of client authentication. |
| **MQTT Client Certificate Configurations**  |  In *configs/mqtt_client_config.h*  |
| `CLIENT_CERTIFICATE` <br> `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY`  | Certificate and private key of the MQTT Client used for client authentication. Note that these macros are applicable only when `MQTT_SECURE_CONNECTION` is set to `1`.      |
| `ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE`      |  Root CA certificate of the MQTT Broker |
| **MQTT Message Configurations**    |  In *configs/mqtt_client_config.h*  |
| `MQTT_PUB_TOPIC`           | MQTT topic to which the messages are published by the Publisher task to the MQTT Broker    |
| `MQTT_SUB_TOPIC`           | MQTT topic to which the Subscriber task subscribes to. The MQTT Broker sends the messages to the Subscriber that are published in this topic (or equivalent topic).  |
| `MQTT_MESSAGES_QOS`        | The Quality of Service (QoS) level to be used by the Publisher and Subscriber. Valid choices are `0`, `1`, and `2`.  |
| `ENABLE_LWT_MESSAGE`       | Set this macro to `1` if you want to use the 'Last Will and Testament (LWT)' option; else `0`. LWT is an MQTT message that will be published by the MQTT Broker on the specified topic if the MQTT connection is unexpectedly closed. This configuration is sent to the MQTT Broker during MQTT connect operation; the MQTT Broker will publish the Will message on the Will topic when it recognizes an unexpected disconnection from the client. |
| `MQTT_WILL_TOPIC_NAME` <br> `MQTT_WILL_MESSAGE`   | The MQTT topic and message for the LWT option described above. These configurations are applicable only when `ENABLE_LWT_MESSAGE` is set to `1`.  |
| `MQTT_DEVICE_ON_MESSAGE` <br> `MQTT_DEVICE_OFF_MESSAGE`  | The MQTT messages that control the device (LED) state in this code example.  |
| **Other MQTT Client Configurations**    |  In *configs/mqtt_client_config.h*  |
| `GENERATE_UNIQUE_CLIENT_ID`   | Every active MQTT connection must have a unique client identifier. If this macro is set to `1`, the device will generate a unique client identifier by appending a timestamp to the string specified by the `MQTT_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER` macro. This feature is useful if you are using the same code on multiple kits simultaneously.   |
| `MQTT_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER`     | The client identifier (client ID) string to be used during MQTT connection. If `GENERATE_UNIQUE_CLIENT_ID` is set to `1`, a timestamp is appended to this macro value and used as the client ID; else, the value specified for this macro is directly used as the client ID.   |
| `MQTT_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER_MAX_LEN`   | The longest client identifier that an MQTT server must accept (as defined by the MQTT 3.1.1 spec) is 23 characters. However, some MQTT Brokers support longer client IDs. Configure this macro as per the MQTT Broker specification.  |
| `MQTT_TIMEOUT_MS`            | Timeout in milliseconds for MQTT operations in this example   |
| `MQTT_KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS`    | The keepalive interval in seconds used for MQTT ping request   |
| `MQTT_ALPN_PROTOCOL_NAME`   | The Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) protocol name to be used that is supported by the MQTT Broker in use. Note that this is an optional macro for most of the use cases. <br>Per IANA, the port numbers assigned for MQTT protocol are 1883 for non-secure connections and 8883 for secure connections. In some cases, there is a need to use other ports for MQTT like port 443 (which is reserved for HTTPS). ALPN is an extension to TLS that allows many protocols to be used over a secure connection.     |
| `MQTT_SNI_HOSTNAME`   | The Server Name Indication (SNI) host name to be used during the Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection as specified by the MQTT Broker. <br>SNI is extension to the TLS protocol. As required by some MQTT Brokers, SNI typically includes the hostname in the "Client Hello" message sent during TLS handshake.     |
| `MQTT_NETWORK_BUFFER_SIZE`   | A network buffer is allocated for sending and receiving MQTT packets over the network. Specify the size of this buffer using this macro. Note that the minimum buffer size is defined by `CY_MQTT_MIN_NETWORK_BUFFER_SIZE` macro in the MQTT library.  |
| `MAX_MQTT_CONN_RETRIES`   | Maximum number of retries for MQTT connection   |
| `MQTT_CONN_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`   | Time interval in milliseconds in between successive MQTT connection retries   |

#### Setting up the MQTT Broker

<details><summary><b>AWS IoT MQTT</b></summary>

 1. Set up the MQTT device (also known as a *Thing*) in the AWS IoT Core as described in the [Getting started with AWS IoT tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-gs.html).

    **Note:** While setting up your device, ensure that the policy associated with this device permits all MQTT operations (*iot:Connect*, *iot:Publish*, *iot:Receive*, and *iot:Subscribe*) for the resource used by this device. For testing purposes, it is recommended to have the following policy document which allows all *MQTT Policy Actions* on all *Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)*.
    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "iot:*",
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

 2. In the *configs/mqtt_client_config.h* file, set `MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS` to your custom endpoint on the **Settings** page of the AWS IoT Console. This has the format `ABCDEFG1234567.iot.<region>.amazonaws.com`.

 3. Set the macros `MQTT_PORT` to `8883` and `MQTT_SECURE_CONNECTION` to `1` in the *configs/mqtt_client_config.h* file.

 4. Download the following certificates and keys that are created and activated in the previous step:
       - A certificate for the AWS IoT Thing - *xxxxxxxxxx.cert.pem*
       - A public key - *xxxxxxxxxx.public.key*
       - A private key - *xxxxxxxxxx.private.key*
       - Root CA "RSA 2048 bit key: Amazon Root CA 1" for AWS IoT from [CA Certificates for Server Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/server-authentication.html#server-authentication-certs).

 5. Using these certificates and keys, enter the following parameters in *mqtt_client_config.h* in Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) format:
       - `CLIENT_CERTIFICATE` - *xxxxxxxxxx.cert.pem*
       - `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY` - *xxxxxxxxxx.private.key*
       - `ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE` - Root CA certificate

    You can either convert the values to strings manually following the format shown in *mqtt_client_config.h* or you can use the HTML utility available [here](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/amazon-freertos/blob/master/tools/certificate_configuration/PEMfileToCString.html) to convert the certificates and keys from PEM format to C string format. You need to clone the repository from GitHub to use the utility.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Local Mosquitto Broker</b></summary>

Download and install the Mosquitto Broker for your computer from https://mosquitto.org/download. The following instructions help in setting up the Mosquitto Broker for a secure connection with the client using self-signed SSL certificates. This requires **OpenSSL** which is already preloaded in the ModusToolbox installation. Run the below commands with a CLI (on Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application).

1. Generate the CA certificate for the Mosquitto Broker / Server using the following commands. Follow the instructions in the command window to provide the details required.
   ```
   openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
   openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
   ```

2. Generate the server key pair and server certificate (signed using the CA certificate from step 1) for the Mosquitto Broker using the following commands. Follow the instructions in the command window to provide the details required.
   ```
   openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
   openssl req -new -nodes -sha256 -key server.key -out server.csr
   openssl x509 -req -sha256 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365
   ```

   At this stage, the certificates and keys required by the Mosquitto broker are ready. The files used from the above steps are *ca.crt*, *server.crt*, and *server.key*.

3. Create a configuration file for the Mosquitto Broker - *mosquitto.conf* with the following contents and provide the path to the generated credentials (*ca.crt*, *server.crt*, and *server.key*) under the SSL settings section.
   ```
   # Config file for mosquitto
   connection_messages true
   per_listener_settings true

   listener 8883
   require_certificate true
   use_identity_as_username true
   allow_anonymous false

   # SSL settings
   cafile <path-to-ca.crt>
   keyfile <path-to-server.key>
   certfile <path-to-server.crt>
   ```

4. Start the Mosquitto Broker with the configurations from the above *mosquitto.conf* file using the following command. If the *mosquitto.conf* file is present in a different location from where the command is run, provide the path to the config file after the `-c` argument in the following command:
   ```
   mosquitto -v -c mosquitto.conf
   ```

5. Generate the client certificates using the following commands. Follow the instructions in the command window to provide the details required. Note that the last command requires *ca.crt* and *ca.key* files generated in Step 2.
   ```
   openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048
   openssl req -new -out client.csr -key client.key
   openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days 365
   ```

6. Configure the MQTT Client configurations in *configs/mqtt_client_config.h* as follows:

     - `MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS` as the IP address of the computer running the Mosquitto Broker (the computer on which Step 4 is performed).

     - `MQTT_PORT` as `8883`.

     - `MQTT_SECURE_CONNECTION` as `1`.

     - Using the client certificate (*client.crt*), private key (*client.key*), and root CA certificate (*ca.crt*) from the above steps, configure the `CLIENT_CERTIFICATE`, `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE` macros respectively.

       You can either convert the PEM format values to strings manually following the format shown in *mqtt_client_config.h* or you can use the HTML utility available [here](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/amazon-freertos/blob/master/tools/certificate_configuration/PEMfileToCString.html) to convert the certificates and keys from PEM format to C string format. You need to clone the repository from GitHub to use the utility.

</details>

Although this section provides instructions only for AWS IoT and local Mosquitto Broker, the MQTT Client implemented in this example is generic. It is expected to work with other MQTT Brokers with appropriate configurations. See the [list of publicly-accessible MQTT Brokers](https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/public_brokers) that can be used for testing and prototyping purposes.
